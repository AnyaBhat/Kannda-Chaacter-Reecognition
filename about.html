        <h1>About</h1>
        <ul>Kannada, a vibrant Dravidian language spoken predominantly in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, boasts
            a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. With its origins deeply rooted in ancient history, Kannada has
            evolved into a modern language with a distinctive script. The Kannada script, derived from the Brahmi
            script, is an abugida system, employing characters that represent consonant-vowel syllables. Each consonant
            carries an inherent "a" vowel sound, and diacritic marks are utilized to modify the vowel or represent
            standalone consonants. The script's directional flow is left to right, and it encompasses consonant
            conjuncts and vowel diacritics, allowing for a versatile representation of sounds. The Kannada script is not
            only a means of written communication but also an integral part of Karnataka's cultural identity, featured
            in ancient inscriptions, literature, and contemporary digital platforms. It serves as a testament to the
            enduring linguistic and cultural legacy of the Kannada-speaking people.</ul>

        <ul>This handwritten character recognition project mainly focuses on the task of recognizing the handwritten
            documents commonly found in stateâ€™s government officials and healthcare departments of the state
            Karnataka.Since manually converting these documents into digital format is a tedious task and it consumes
            more time and also it would be very difficult to reproduce the contents of these old documents which becomes
            difficult to read and understand, Hence in this recent research fields of study the handwritten character
            recognition(HCR) is used to recognize the characters from the image that is given as the input source and
            predicts the Kannada character as the output. So, the neural network approach is used for better performance
            and accuracy. </ul>
